## Simple library to make interacting with multi-dimensional arrays easier in C++, whilst remaining simple and performant.

Cython is also used to bridge C++ and Python, allowing multiple copies of the array backed by the same data.

To compile to extension module:

```
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Code is self-documenting for now ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
